# phenylspirodrimanes

This repository contains code and data for generating and analyzing a virtual library of phenylspirodrimanes. The goal is to explore chemical diversity by enumerating natural product-inspired drimane/spirodrimane cores with commercially available ortho-halophenols, followed by cheminformatics-based property calculations and chemical space visualization.
